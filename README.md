This is a terminal Magic 8 ball. It was an exercise given to me to do during my Computer Sciences.

You are able to enter your name of the name of a family member or friend, and type in the question you want the program to answer.

The responses are randomly selected and you are able top increase the number of responses, however once the amount of responses are increased
be sure to adjust this (random_number = random.randint(1, 13) line of code to suit the amount of responses you have.

I had a lot of fun with this one, Enjoy
